**Enable interactive debugging in web browser for your AI application with a few lines of code.**

## Why?

Debugging AI applications is time-consuming and cumbersome.
Especially for early stage development, it doesn’t make sense to build e2e product just to test, or setup automated tests/evals.
So the process ends up being a lot of inputting awkwardly into the command line, and looking through walls of logs in different places.
